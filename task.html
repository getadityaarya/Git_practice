    <p style="width: 600px; height: auto; padding: 30px; margin: auto;">Books have a profound impact on how we think by shaping our perspectives, expanding our worldview, and challenging our existing beliefs. When we read, we temporarily step into someone else’s experiences, ideas, and imagination, which strengthens our ability to analyze, empathize, and think critically. Books also expose us to new vocabulary, complex narratives, and different ways of solving problems, gradually rewiring how we form thoughts and make decisions. Whether fiction or non-fiction, books stimulate creativity and reflective thinking, helping us understand ourselves and the world around us more deeply.</p>
