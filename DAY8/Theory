1. What is Asynchronous Programming?
Ans- Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform time-consuming tasks (like fetching data from a server) without stopping the rest of the program.
This ensures that the webpage remains responsive and does not freeze while waiting for data.

2. Why JavaScript Needs Asynchronous Behavior?
Ans- JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it executes one task at a time.
Asynchronous behavior helps JavaScript handle:
    a). API requests
    b). Timers and delays
    c). Data loading from backend
    d).User interactions
- Without asynchronous handling, the browser would stop responding during slow operations.

3. setTimeout (Delay Mechanism): 
Ans- setTimeout is used to execute a task after a specific delay.
The delay is measured in milliseconds.
Key points:
    a). The code does not stop execution
    b). Other tasks continue running
    c). Used for delays, animations, notifications, and loaders

4. Promises in JavaScript:
Ans- A Promise represents a task that will be completed in the future.
It is mainly used to handle asynchronous operations.
Promise States:
    a. Pending – task is in progress
    b. Fulfilled – task completed successfully
    c. Rejected – task failed
- Promises help manage success and failure in a structured way.

5. Handling Promises: 
Ans. romises are handled using:
    then – runs when the task is successful
    catch – runs when an error occurs
- This separation makes error handling clean and readable.

6. Async and Await:
Ans- async and await provide a simpler and cleaner way to work with Promises.
Key ideas:
    a). async marks a function as asynchronous
    b). await pauses execution until the task completes
    c). The browser continues working in the background
    d). Async/await improves readability and avoids complex chaining.

7. Error Handling in Asynchronous Code:
Errors in asynchronous operations must be handled properly to prevent crashes.
Using structured error handling:
    a). Keeps the application stable
    b). Helps identify problems easily
    c). Improves debugging and user experience

8. Fetching Data from a Server:
Ans. Fetching data means requesting information from an external source (API).
This process is asynchronous because network requests take time.
Important points:
    a). Data arrives after some delay
    b). The program continues running meanwhile
    c). Commonly used to load user data, products, posts, etc.

9. Loading Indicators:
Ans. While data is being fetched, applications often show:
    a). Loading messages
    b). Spinners or progress indicators
    c). This improves user experience by informing users that the system is working.

10. Event-Driven Asynchronous Actions:
Ans- Asynchronous functions are often triggered by:
a). Button clicks
b). User actions
c). Page events
-This allows users to control when data is loaded.

11. Displaying Fetched Data on Webpages
Ans- After data is received from a server, it must be:
    a). Processed    
    b). Displayed on the webpage
    c). This is done using dynamic content updates, which is a key part of modern web applications.

12. Local Storage in the Browser
Ans- Local Storage is used to store data inside the browser.
Key characteristics:
    a). Data remains even after page refresh
    b). Used for saving user data, preferences, or API responses
    c). Stores data in text format

13. Promise vs Async/Await
Ans- Both Promises and async/await achieve the same goal.
Difference:
    a). Promises use chaining
    b). Async/await offers better readability
    c).Async/await is preferred for large and complex applications.

14. Advantages of Asynchronous Programming
Ans- Keeps the webpage responsive
    a). Handles slow operations efficiently
    b). Improves user experience
    c). Makes applications scalable and reliable
