What is React?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page web applications. React works by dividing the user interface into small reusable components. Each component controls a part of the UI and updates efficiently when data changes.

Why React is Used?

React makes web applications faster and more interactive. It allows developers to reuse components, manage data efficiently, and build complex user interfaces using simple logic. React follows a component-based architecture which improves code readability and maintenance.

What is Vite?

Vite is a modern frontend build tool used to create and run React applications quickly. It provides a fast development environment and simple project setup. Vite uses modern JavaScript features and offers very fast startup and reload times compared to older tools.

Why Vite is Preferred?

Vite starts the development server instantly. It provides faster page reloads during development. Vite requires less configuration and makes project creation easier. It is lightweight and well suited for modern React projects.

Creating a React Web App using Vite.

To create a React application using Vite, a command is executed in the terminal. After selecting React as the framework, the project folder is created. Dependencies are installed and the development server is started. The application then runs locally in the browser.

App Function (Main App Component):

The App function is the main component of a React application created using Vite. It acts as the root component where all other components are used. The App component controls the overall structure and layout of the application.

Separate Component Files:

React applications are divided into multiple components. Each component is usually written in a separate file. This makes the project well organized, easier to understand, and simpler to maintain. Separate components also promote reusability.

Writing Functions for Each Component:

In React, each component is written as a function. These functions return user interface elements. Writing components as separate functions helps in managing the UI logic independently.

What are Props in React?

Props stands for Properties. Props are used to pass data from one component to another, mainly from a parent component to a child component. Props help components display dynamic content and make them reusable.

Characteristics of Props:

Props are read-only and cannot be modified inside the child component. They are passed as attributes to components. Props support one-way data flow, which makes applications predictable and easier to debug.

Exporting Components:

To use a component in another file, it must be exported. Exporting allows components written in separate files to be reused in the App component or other components.

Importing Components:

After exporting a component, it can be imported into another file. Imported components can then be used inside the App component just like normal elements.

React Fragments (Empty Wrapper Concept):

Fragments are used in React to group multiple elements without adding an extra div to the DOM. They act as empty wrappers and help in returning multiple elements from a component.

Why Fragments are Used?

React components must return a single parent element. Fragments allow multiple elements to be returned together without adding unnecessary HTML elements. This keeps the DOM clean and improves structure.

One-Line Summary:

React is a library for building user interfaces using components, and Vite is a fast build tool used to create and run React applications efficiently.
